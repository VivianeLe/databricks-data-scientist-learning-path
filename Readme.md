- **What is Delta Lake?**
    
    Today, many organizations struggle with achieving successful big data and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. One of the biggest challenges they face is ensuring that quality, reliable data is available to data practitioners running these projects. After all, an organization that does not have reliable data will not succeed with AI. To help organizations bring structure, reliability, and performance to their data lakes, Databricks created Delta Lake.


    Delta Lake is an open format storage layer that sits on top of your organization’s data lake. It is the foundation of a cost-effective, highly scalable Lakehouse and is an integral part of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.


    In this course (formerly Fundamentals of Delta Lake), we’ll break down the basics behind Delta Lake - what it does, how it works, and why it is valuable from a business perspective, to any organization with big data and AI projects.


    Learning objectives
    - Describe how Delta Lake fits into the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.
